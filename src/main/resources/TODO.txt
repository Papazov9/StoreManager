TODO List:
Search bar -> searching by everything with a filter and also suggestions(hard one)

Make descrption hover multiline not on one row only.

Questionable?? More simple way to be shown product in preparation(just buttons for decide and id to know which item we are looking for) MAYBE not totally clear idea :)

Move Action:
    -sell, fix and scrap buttons instead of dropdown menu and confirm action before moving onto the next slide
    -small and big buttons instead of dropdown menu and confirm action before moving onto the next slide
    -in choose rack section give a list of racks for the appropriate size(if small only racks which are for small products and respective for big)
    -think of a way when reach last position in rack generate button to move on the next rack nto sending an error message.

Racks View:
    -when click on one of the racks to show a view of the products in this rack

Scrap action and view:
    -when click on scrap in move action to go onto slide where to choose 1-4 pallet id in which to store the product
    -check if products in current pallet are 30 or above if so activate the export button, which downloads an excel file
    -scrap view shows 4 lists for the pallets with items in them and below the list is the export button(active if only the list has 30 or more products)

Sold Products View:
    -in selling view add button SOLD which removes the products from selling, add it to sold table and setting a sold boolean and timestamp when the product is sold
    -in sold view the products should be order by this timestamp Desc
    -Questionable??? be able to export a file for the sold items ???
